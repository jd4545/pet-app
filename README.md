# "Take a paws" petsitter finder app

This app is designed for pet owners to find pet-sitters near them to look after their pets, and for pet-sitters to list their services.

Check out the app [here!](https://pet-app-beta.vercel.app/)

This app was conceived, planned and developed as the final project for the Northcoders coding bootcamp.
I was part of a team of six to complete this project within two weeks from start to finish.
We settled on a pet-sitter finder app with the remit of being user-friendly, well-designed, informative and fun.

## Team working
- We spiked various new technologies and ideas for apps
- Settled on the pet-finder app idea and worked on a wireframe plan
- Agile working with daily stand ups and a kanban board
- co-ordinated commits on Github to minimise conflicts
- split into teams to work as pairs, with regular updates to/from rest of the team
- team spirits were high despite the pressure and we supported each other when needed
- we are proud of our final product!

## Techs used
- built on a React JS front-end
- authentication using Firebase
- back-end data stored on Firestore noSQL database for flexibility
- data manipulation using Firestrore and node.js
- implemented our own version of a distance calculator using postcodes.io API and node.js
- leaflet for map showing user locations and services
- instant messaging feature using Firebase
- styling with Bootstrap

## Future features 
Given more time we would have implemented:
- calendar feature to select availability for pet-sitter and search for pet-owner
- more data and personalisation features for users
