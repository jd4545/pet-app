# "Take a paws" petsitter finder app

Check out the app [here!](https://pet-app-beta.vercel.app/)

This app was conceived, planned and developed as the final project for the Northcoders coding bootcamp.
I was part of a team of six to complete this project within two weeks from start to finish.
We settled on a pet-sitter finder app with the remit of being user-friendly, well-designed, informative and fun.
